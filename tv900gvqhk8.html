The entire full text of papers - not just the title and abstract - will be indexed by search engines and scholarly repositories, boosting content visibility. Moreover, articles in HTML have a well-defined semantic structure, making them fully machine-readable objects. <b>The arXiv of the future will rethink papers as APIs that access semantically structured content</b>.</div><h1 data-label="349165" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div><span>We have looked at the history of the arXiv, identifying a number of possible reasons that determined its success as the most popular online preprint repository.

We believe that in the era of the web, sharing research via PDF will inevitably come to an end. Let us embrace new technologies and practices, just like the arXiv did nearly 30 years ago so that we might create a better way to share research.</span></div><div></div>
