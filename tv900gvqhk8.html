<h2 data-label="272554" class="ltx_title_subsection">Structured, semantic, machine-readable content</h2><div>Papers in HTML come with a number of advantages over papers in PDF. First of all, the entire full text will be indexed by search engines and scholarly repositories, boosting content visibility.The arXiv is a preprint repository. Authorea, in contrast, is a social, open science platform. It provides scholars with a&nbsp;profile page, including bios and statistics. Institutions also have dedicated&nbsp;pages and collaboration statistics. Authors can keep track of their academic connections and discover new content. Authorea is the place where the next generation of research will be created, shared, and reviewed. Additionally, the fact that Authorea articles have a well-defined semantic structure will allow them to be fully machine-readable objects. The preprints of the future will be an API you can interact with.</div><h2 data-label="386048" class="ltx_title_subsection">Content creation and publication / writing is publishing</h2><div></div>
