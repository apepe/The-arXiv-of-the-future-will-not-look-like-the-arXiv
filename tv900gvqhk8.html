<h2 data-label="272554" class="ltx_title_subsection">Discoverable, structured, semantic, machine-readable</h2><div>One final but very important advantage that is tightly linked to having a repository of HTML, rather than PDF, papers is discoverability. The entire full text of papers - not just the title and abstract - will be indexed by search engines and scholarly repositories, boosting content visibility. Moreover, articles in HTML have a well-defined semantic structure, making them fully machine-readable objects. <b>The arXiv of the future will rethink papers as APIs that access semantically structured content</b>.</div><h1 data-label="349165" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div><span>We have looked at the history of the arXiv, identifying a number of possible reasons that determined its success as the most popular online preprint repository for the hard sciences, with more than one million submissions since its inception. The arXiv flourished because it catered to&nbsp;</span>technically savvy researchers with a long standing tradition of sharing and collaboration (Physics, for example, is one of the most highly collaborative fields of research). &nbsp;The simplicity of the site and its LaTeX-centric submission process, secured rapid growth within communities&nbsp;that were already used to take full charge of the typesetting process, and were comfortable with sharing their documents with colleagues.</div><div><span>The arxiv, while quick to adopt technology early on, has changed very little since it's launch both in terms of operations as well as technology. The limited  adoption of new technologies and practices that could further strengthen the arXiv and the research it hosts, represents a wea. Here we argue what those changes are as a challenge to arXiv and as a call to researchers to demand more. We believe that in the era of the web, sharing research via PDF will inevitably come to an end. Let us embrace new technologies and practices, just like the arXiv did nearly 30 years ago so that we might create a better way to share research.</span></div><div></div>
