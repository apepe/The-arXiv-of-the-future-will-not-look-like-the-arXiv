<div>6. Structured HTML Documents will power the preprint repository of the future&nbsp;</div><div>The arXiv is a preprint repository. Authorea, in contrast, is a social, open science platform. It provides scholars with a&nbsp;profile page, including bios and statistics. Institutions also have dedicated&nbsp;pages and collaboration statistics. Authors can keep track of their academic connections and discover new content. Authorea is the place where the next generation of research will be created, shared, and reviewed. Additionally, the fact that Authorea articles have a well-defined semantic structure will allow them to be fully machine-readable objects. The preprints of the future will be an API you can interact with.</div>
