The entire full text of papers - not just the title and abstract - will be indexed by search engines and scholarly repositories, boosting content visibility. Moreover, articles in HTML have a well-defined semantic structure, making them fully machine-readable objects. <b>The arXiv of the future will rethink papers as APIs that access semantically structured content</b>.</div><h1 data-label="349165" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div><span>We have looked at the history of the arXiv, identifying a number of possible reasons that determined its success as the most popular online preprint repository for the hard sciences, with more than one million submissions since its inception.
