<div>2. For LaTeX users. And for everyone else too!</div><div>The ArXiv relies heavily on LaTeX.&nbsp;For Authorea, LaTeX is one of many&nbsp; formats you can write in. Other formats include Markdown, and HTML (rich text, like Word!). Authorea offers a format-neutral, web-native platform. Regardless of the format, you render content on the web - not on a separate pane that compiles a PDF (side note, you can still export a PDF). The advantage: Authorea documents are not constrained to the hard sciences and to the LaTeX community. Authorea is for all scholars: from&nbsp;astrophysics to&nbsp;zoology. Authorea's rich text editor is a true WYSIWYG editor (What you see is what you get). It also has the ability to include&nbsp;as much LaTeX and mathematical notation as you need.&nbsp;Every document written in Authorea becomes a beautiful webpage, like this one.</div>
