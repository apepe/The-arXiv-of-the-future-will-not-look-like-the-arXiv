<div>Before the&nbsp; the arXiv, there was the SPIRES-HEP database (Stanford Physics Information REtrieval System) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). SPIRES collected, organized, and maintained research documents and bibliographic information from the field of high energy physics (HEP). Developed in the&nbsp;early 70's, SPIRES created a standard used across universities that&nbsp;allowed&nbsp; researchers to email the database and request a list of preprints be sent to them. Since papers themselves could not be emailed at the time, the system relied on traditional mail.&nbsp;Such a resource was immediately successful with requests&nbsp;numbering in the thousands within the first few years.While SPIRES greatly improved the flow of information, it often still took weeks for the articles (preprints) to reach their requester’s mailbox.&nbsp; A typesetting system called .tex introduced in the late 70’s by Donald Knuth&nbsp;soon changed this. Tex and later LaTeX, a bla bla bla, made it easy for&nbsp;researchers typeset their manuscript in a defined and programmatic way. This system&nbsp; made sharing papers easier and cheaper than ever before. Indeed, many, if not most, researchers at the time relied upon secretaries or typists to write their work, which then had to be photocopied in order to be sent via mail to a handful of other researchers. Tex allowed researchers to write their documents in a specified manner that could be emailed and then downloaded and compiled without the need for physical mail. Soon, physicists were emailing and downloading .tex files at great rates hastening the process of research communication. Such a system immediately created a new problem of information overload with researchers 15mb computers filling up quickly with emails <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ginsparg_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; To address this problem, an automated email server, arXiv, was set up in the early 90's, which would allow researchers to automatically request preprints via email. It would soon become one of the world's first web servers and today serves as one of the most open and efficient forms of research communication in the world. &nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="700903" class="ltx_title_section">The strengths of the arXiv</h1><div>ThearXiv has since day one provided researchers with one of the easiest and most powerful ways to disseminate their research. It is free for authors to rapidly share findings directly with the research community as well as the public and is home to some of the world's most important work, like the proof to the&nbsp;Poincaré conjecture <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2002math}</cite> and the discovery of the Higgs Boson&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2012Ph}</cite>.&nbsp;The free exchange of information has been without equal in most other fields for nearly two decades until very recently with the launch of numerous arXiv clones in disciplines not covered by arXiv (bioRxiv, SocArxiv, etc; see Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{859899}</span>). The ease of use and the utility of arXiv is both a function of the community it serves--technically advanced researchers with a long standing tradition of sharing and collaboration--as well as the simplicity of the site. Below we highlight key pieces of technology as well as cultural influences that contributed to the success of arXiv. &nbsp;We also highlight how such pieces may be a limitation to new, and better, practices.</div><h2 data-label="707263" class="ltx_title_subsection">Typesetting with LaTeX</h2><div>The majority of papers on arXiv are authored in LaTeX, a typesetting system developed and introduced by Donald Knuth in 19xx. LaTeX was developed to LaTeX solved this problem in an efficient way as it allowed researchers to share their work in an automated way via&nbsp; markup files that could be compiled locally. Arguably such a solution would only have ever been adopted by the exact community it served, namely physicists and mathematicians, because of how complex LaTeX is to learn and use. Indeed, to this day most researchers outside of physics and consequently outside of arXiv, write their manuscripts in Microsoft Word or other WYSIWYG editors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pepe}</cite>. Thus, LaTeX was crucial to the early success of preprints and peer to peer sharing. &nbsp;It continues to be the dominant way that researchers write technical documents in physics and math.</div><h2 data-label="105418" class="ltx_title_subsection">A culmination of tech, culture, and community</h2><div>The serendipitous culmination of new technology in a community that both knew how to take advantage of it and was willing to take advantage of it allowed arXiv to flourish from the very first day. &nbsp;Other fields, like chemistry and biomedicine are also highly collaborative in nature <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fanelli_2016}</cite>&nbsp;albeit not to the extent of physics, however they may have lacked the early knowledge to write in LaTeX and set up and run email and web servers, two necessary aspects to the foundation of arXiv. Interestingly, however what made arXiv an immediate success may also be it's undoing should it not adopt new technologies like it did from the outset.</div><div></div><h1>The weaknesses of the arXiv</h1><div>Blah blah</div><h1 data-label="332132" class="ltx_title_section">What would the arXiv of the future will look like</h1><div>We envision blah blah</div><h2 data-label="724278" class="ltx_title_subsection">1. A scholarly repository is more than a&nbsp;PDF dump</h2><div>There is growing consensus in scholarly communication circles that academic publishing needs to move "beyond the PDF" (see the manifesto of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.force11.org/" target="_blank">Force 11</a>). PDFs are a great portable format for printing, but they are not the best format to share, discuss, and read on the web. Every article on arXiv is a PDF (built from LaTeX). As such, it is static, 2-dimensional and&nbsp;<i>non-actionable</i>. It is not a stretch to say that a paper in PDF is merely a digital photograph of a piece of paper. We can, and are doing, better than that.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/browse-open-science-articles" target="_blank">Authorea's repository</a>&nbsp;is a collection of Open Access and Open Science (i.e. data driven) web native papers.</div>
