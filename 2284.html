<div>Before the&nbsp; the arXiv, there was the SPIRES-HEP database (Stanford Physics Information REtrieval System) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). SPIRES collected, organized, and maintained research documents and bibliographic information from the field of high energy physics (HEP). Developed in the&nbsp;early 70's, SPIRES created a standard used across universities that&nbsp;allowed&nbsp; researchers to email the database and request a list of preprints be sent to them. Since papers themselves could not be emailed at the time, the system relied on traditional mail.&nbsp;Such a resource was immediately successful with requests&nbsp;numbering in the thousands within the first few years.While SPIRES greatly improved the flow of information, it often still took weeks for the articles (preprints) to reach their requester’s mailbox.&nbsp; A typesetting system called .tex introduced in the late 70’s by Donald Knuth&nbsp;soon changed this. Tex and later LaTeX, a bla bla bla, made it easy for&nbsp;researchers typeset their manuscript in a defined and programmatic way. This system&nbsp; made sharing papers easier and cheaper than ever before. Indeed, many, if not most, researchers at the time relied upon secretaries or typists to write their work, which then had to be photocopied in order to be sent via mail to a handful of other researchers. Tex allowed researchers to write their documents in a specified manner that could be emailed and then downloaded and compiled without the need for physical mail. Soon, physicists were emailing and downloading .tex files at great rates hastening the process of research communication. Such a system immediately created a new problem of information overload with researchers 15mb computers filling up quickly with emails <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ginsparg_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; To address this problem, an automated email server, arXiv, was set up in the early 90's, which would allow researchers to automatically request preprints via email. It would soon become one of the world's first web servers and today serves as one of the most open and efficient forms of research communication in the world. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
