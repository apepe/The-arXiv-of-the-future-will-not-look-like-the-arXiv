<div></div><h1 data-label="700903" class="ltx_title_section">The strengths of the arXiv</h1><div>The arXiv has since day one provided researchers with one of the easiest and most powerful ways to disseminate their research. It is a free way for authors to rapidly share findings directly with the research community, and a free way for the public to access it. The ArXiv is home to some of the world's most important work, like the proof to the&nbsp;Poincar√© conjecture <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2002math}</cite> and the discovery of the Higgs Boson&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2012Ph}</cite>. The free exchange of information has been without equal in most other fields for nearly two decades until very recently with the launch of numerous arXiv clones in new disciplines (see Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{859899}</span>). The ease of use and the utility of arXiv is both a function of the community it serves--technically advanced researchers with a long standing tradition of sharing and collaboration--as well as the simplicity of the site. Below we highlight key pieces of technology as well as cultural influences that contributed to the success of arXiv. &nbsp;We then highlight in the next section how such pieces may be a limitation to new, and better, practices.</div><h2 data-label="707263" class="ltx_title_subsection">Typesetting with LaTeX</h2><div>While the arXiv now allows upload of Microsoft Word manuscripts (which are converted to PDF), the vast majority of papers on arXiv are authored in LaTeX. LaTeX allows researchers to easily typeset and share their documents. Such a solution was available to all researchers at the outset, however it was only adopted by the exact community it served, namely physicists and mathematicians, because of how complex LaTeX is to learn and use. Thus, LaTeX was crucial to the early success of preprints and peer-to-peer sharing. &nbsp;Today it continues to be used by physicists, computer engineers, and others as it offers the best and most complete toolkit for writing mathematical notation.</div><h2 data-label="105418" class="ltx_title_subsection">A culture of collaboration and sharing</h2><div>The serendipitous culmination of new technology in a community that both knew how to take advantage of it and was willing to take advantage of it allowed arXiv to flourish from the very first day. Physics is one of the most highly collaborative fields of research <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fanelli_2016}</cite>, accounting for nine of the ten most highly authored papers ever and over 90% of all published papers with over 100 authors in the author list&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{King_2012}</cite>. Other fields, like chemistry and biomedicine, that are also increasingly highly collaborative in nature <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fanelli_2016}</cite>, may have lacked the early knowledge to write in LaTeX and set up and run email and web servers --- two necessary aspects to the foundation of the arXiv.</div><div></div><h1>The weaknesses of the arXiv</h1><div>The arXiv benefited immediate and sustained success since its inception thanks to its willingness to utilize new technology (LaTeX, email, web servers) in a community naturally tech-savvy, collaborative, and open to sharing practices. However, the arXiv has failed to improve and rethink itself over time, to match the ever changing landscape of technology and community practices in science. What is the single most important factor that has not allowed the arXiv to quickly innovate? We believe it is LaTeX. The technological advancement that has allowed the arXiv to flourish, is also, incredibly, its most important shortcoming. Indeed, the reliance of the arXiv on LaTeX is the source of all the points of weakness listed below.</div><h2 data-label="415532" class="ltx_title_subsection">Limitation to a single community</h2><div>Most researchers outside of physics, and consequently outside of arXiv, write their manuscripts in Microsoft Word or other WYSIWYG editors. Using LaTeX penetration rates in its most popular fields (mathematics, statistics, physics, astronomy, computer science) it is possible to estimate the total percentage of scholarly articles written in LaTeX to be around 18%&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pepea}</cite>. &nbsp;LaTeX has a steep learning curve and its in</div><div>Not web friendly</div><div>Discoverability</div><div>Data</div><div>LaTeX documents are still the submission of choice for most researchers and &nbsp;The argument, "if it isn't broke, don't fix it" might come to mind, however what does not evolve does not survive.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="332132" class="ltx_title_section">How the ArXiv would look like if we built it today</h1><div>We envision blah blah</div><h2 data-label="724278" class="ltx_title_subsection">1. A scholarly repository is more than a&nbsp;PDF dump</h2><div>There is growing consensus in scholarly communication circles that academic publishing needs to move "beyond the PDF" (see the manifesto of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.force11.org/" target="_blank">Force 11</a>). PDFs are a great portable format for printing, but they are not the best format to share, discuss, and read on the web. Every article on arXiv is a PDF (built from LaTeX). As such, it is static, 2-dimensional and&nbsp;<i>non-actionable</i>. It is not a stretch to say that a paper in PDF is merely a digital photograph of a piece of paper. We can, and are doing, better than that.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/browse-open-science-articles" target="_blank">Authorea's repository</a>&nbsp;is a collection of Open Access and Open Science (i.e. data driven) web native papers.</div>
