<div></div><h1 data-label="700903" class="ltx_title_section">The strengths of the arXiv</h1><div>The arXiv has since day one provided researchers with one of the easiest and most powerful ways to disseminate their research. It is free for authors to rapidly share findings directly with the research community as well as the public and is home to some of the world's most important work, like the proof to the&nbsp;Poincar√© conjecture <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2002math}</cite> and the discovery of the Higgs Boson&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2012Ph}</cite>. The free exchange of information has been without equal in most other fields for nearly two decades until very recently with the launch of numerous arXiv clones in new disciplines (see Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{859899}</span>). The ease of use and the utility of arXiv is both a function of the community it serves--technically advanced researchers with a long standing tradition of sharing and collaboration--as well as the simplicity of the site. Below we highlight key pieces of technology as well as cultural influences that contributed to the success of arXiv. &nbsp;We then highlight in the next section how such pieces may be a limitation to new, and better, practices.</div><h2 data-label="707263" class="ltx_title_subsection">Typesetting with LaTeX</h2><div>The majority of papers on arXiv are authored in LaTeX (cite NEEDED). LaTeX allows researchers to easily typeset and share their documents. &nbsp;Such a solution was available to all researchers at the outset, however it was only adopted by the exact community it served, namely physicists and mathematicians, because of how complex LaTeX is to learn and use. Indeed, to this day most researchers outside of physics and consequently outside of arXiv, write their manuscripts in Microsoft Word or other WYSIWYG editors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pepe}</cite>. Thus, LaTeX was crucial to the early success of preprints and peer-to-peer sharing. &nbsp;Today it continues to be used by physicists, computer engineers, and others as it offers the best method for writing math.</div><h2 data-label="105418" class="ltx_title_subsection">A culture of collaboration and sharing</h2><div>The serendipitous culmination of new technology in a community that both knew how to take advantage of it and was willing to take advantage of it allowed arXiv to flourish from the very first day. &nbsp;Physics is one of the most highly collaborative fields of research <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fanelli_2016}</cite>, accounting for nine of the ten most highly authored papers ever and over 90% of papers with 100-plus authors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{King_2012}</cite>. Other fields, like chemistry and biomedicine are also highly collaborative in nature <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fanelli_2016}</cite>&nbsp;albeit not to the extent of physics, however they may have lacked the early knowledge to write in LaTeX and set up and run email and web servers, two necessary aspects to the foundation of arXiv.</div><h1>The weaknesses of the arXiv</h1><div>arXiv was an immediate success due to it's willingness to adopt and utilize new technology, a tradition that has unfortunately not continued to this day. Indeed, the arXiv has changed very little since it's inception both in looks (see FIG XX)&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Discoverability (arxiv website is in PDF)</div><div>LaTeX documents are still the submission of choice for most researchers and &nbsp;The argument, "if it isn't broke, don't fix it" might come to mind, however what does not evolve does not survive.</div><h2 data-label="456559" class="ltx_title_subsection">LaTeX</h2><div>While we listed LaTeX  as one of the strengths of &nbsp;the arXiv, it is also one of its most important shortcomings.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="332132" class="ltx_title_section">What would the arXiv of the future will look like</h1><div>We envision blah blah</div><h2 data-label="724278" class="ltx_title_subsection">1. A scholarly repository is more than a&nbsp;PDF dump</h2><div>There is growing consensus in scholarly communication circles that academic publishing needs to move "beyond the PDF" (see the manifesto of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.force11.org/" target="_blank">Force 11</a>). PDFs are a great portable format for printing, but they are not the best format to share, discuss, and read on the web. Every article on arXiv is a PDF (built from LaTeX). As such, it is static, 2-dimensional and&nbsp;<i>non-actionable</i>. It is not a stretch to say that a paper in PDF is merely a digital photograph of a piece of paper. We can, and are doing, better than that.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/browse-open-science-articles" target="_blank">Authorea's repository</a>&nbsp;is a collection of Open Access and Open Science (i.e. data driven) web native papers.</div>
