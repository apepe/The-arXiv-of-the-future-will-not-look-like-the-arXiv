Today, the arXiv publishes over 10,000 articles each month from high-energy physics, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, quantitative finance, and others (see Fig <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{859899}</span>). &nbsp;The success of arXiv stems from new technological advances introduced as well as a well-developed culture of collaboration and sharing research papers directly. Indeed, before the arXiv physicists were already emailing one another, a feat which today seems inconsequential but was very technologically advanced at the time.&nbsp;Additionally, they were sharing manuscripts with one another via mail (you couldn't yet email articles). &nbsp; To understand the success of arXiv it is important to understand the history of arXiv. Below we highlight a brief of history technology, services, and cultural norms that predate the arXiv and were integral to it's early and continued success. &nbsp;</div><div>Prior to the arXiv there was the SPIRES-HEP database (Stanford Physics Information REtrieval System- High Energy Physics) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). SPIRES collects, organizes, and maintains research documents and bibliographic information in the field of high energy physics. Developed in the&nbsp;early 70's, SPIRES created a bibliographic standard and centralized resource  that&nbsp;allowed researchers across universities to email the database and request a list of preprints be sent to them. Since papers themselves could not be emailed at the time, the system relied on traditional mail. This resource was&nbsp;immediately successful with requests&nbsp;numbering in the thousands within the first few years. &nbsp;While SPIRES greatly improved the flow of information, it still  took weeks for  articles (preprints) to be sent and received. A typesetting system called .tex introduced in the late 70â€™s by Donald Knuth&nbsp;soon changed this. Tex, was developed for researchers to write and typeset their manuscript in a programmatic way so that it could be run by a variety of different "engines" for visualization. While there are many such en the most popular one a source file that specified typesetting introductions and later LaTeX, a , made it easy for&nbsp;researchers typeset their manuscript in a defined and programmatic way. This system&nbsp; made sharing papers easier and cheaper than ever before. Indeed, many, if not most, researchers at the time relied upon secretaries or typists to write their work, which then had to be photocopied in order to be sent via mail to a handful of other researchers. Tex allowed researchers to write their documents in a specified manner that could be emailed and then downloaded and compiled without the need for physical mail. Soon, physicists were emailing and downloading .tex files at great rates hastening the process of research communication. Such a system immediately created a new problem of information overload with researchers 15mb computers filling up quickly with emails (Ginsparg 2011).&nbsp; To address this problem, an automated email server, arXiv, was set up in the early 90's, which would allow researchers to automatically request preprints via email. It would soon become one of the world's first web servers and today serves as one of the most open and efficient forms of research communication in the world. &nbsp;</div><div>Originally launched as an automated email server to help researchers manage a growing influx of papers being shared via email, the&nbsp;arXiv was one of&nbsp; the first US Web servers and has been from the outset&nbsp;an integral tool for physicists to disseminate their research, receiving four hundred submissions within the first six months <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ginsparg_2011,O_Connell_2000}</cite>. The rapid growth of arXiv&nbsp;was facilitated by the creation and emergence of new technologies that made document creation and dissemination extremely easy, including email, the personal computer, a typesetting system known as LaTeX, and the World Wide Web. &nbsp;The adoption and growth of arXiv also benefitted from the community it served, specifically high-energy physics, a discipline known for collaboration and data sharing (CITE NEEDED). While the arXiv initially covered only the fields of physics and astronomy, it soon grew&nbsp; to encompass other fields, such as computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance and today publishes over 10,000 articles each month (See Fig <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{859899}</span>). The arXiv was quick to adopt and implement new technologies, however it has arguably changed very little since it's inception, at least technically. &nbsp;Here we look at the strengths and weaknesses of arXiv in an effort to identify what possible improvements can be made based on new technologies and tools and propose that a modern arXiv might in fact not look at all like the arXiv of today, which is a good thing.</div><div></div>
