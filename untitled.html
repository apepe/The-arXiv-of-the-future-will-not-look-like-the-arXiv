Started in 1991 by physicist Paul Ginsparg, the arXiv allows researchers to freely share publication-ready articles prior to formal peer review. Originally launched as an automated email server to help researchers manage a growing influx of papers being shared via email, the&nbsp;arXiv was one of&nbsp; the first US Web servers and was from the outset&nbsp; an integral tool for physicists to disseminate their research, receiving 400 submissions in the first six months <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ginsparg_2011,O_Connell_2000}</cite>. The rapid growth of arXiv&nbsp;was facilitated by an emergence of new technologies that made document creation and dissemination extremely easy as compared with previous technologies, including email, the personal computer, a typesetting system known as LaTeX, and the World Wide Web. &nbsp;Additionally, arXiv was born out of a community known for collaboration and data sharing, specifically high-energy physics. While the arXiv initially covered only the fields of physics and astronomy, it soon grew&nbsp; to encompass other fields, such as computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance and today publishes over 10,000 articles each month (See Fig <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{859899}</span>). The arXiv represents a unique place in the history of research communication and the Web itself, however it has arguably changed very little since it's inception. &nbsp;Here we look at the strengths and weaknesses of arXiv in an effort to identify what possible improvements can be made based on new technologies not previously available. We propose that a modern arXiv might in fact not look at all like the arXiv of today.</div><div></div>
