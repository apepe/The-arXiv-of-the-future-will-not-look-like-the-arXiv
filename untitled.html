Today, the arXiv publishes over 10,000 articles each month With over 10,000 preprints sha The success of arXiv stems from new technological advances as well as a communityIndeed, before the arXiv physicists were already widely sharing their manuscripts with one another via mail. The SPIRES-HEP database (Stanford Physics Information REtrieval System) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) collected, organized, and maintained research documents and bibliographic information from the field of high energy physics (HEP). Developed in the&nbsp;early 70's, SPIRES created a standard used across universities that&nbsp;allowed&nbsp; researchers to email the database and request a list of preprints be sent to them. Since papers themselves could not be emailed at the time, the system relied on traditional mail.&nbsp;Such a resource was immediately successful with requests&nbsp;numbering in the thousands within the first few years.While SPIRES greatly improved the flow of information, it often still took weeks for the articles (preprints) to reach their requester’s mailbox.&nbsp; A typesetting system called .tex introduced in the late 70’s by Donald Knuth&nbsp;soon changed this. Tex and later LaTeX, a bla bla bla, made it easy for&nbsp;researchers typeset their manuscript in a defined and programmatic way. This system&nbsp; made sharing papers easier and cheaper than ever before. Indeed, many, if not most, researchers at the time relied upon secretaries or typists to write their work, which then had to be photocopied in order to be sent via mail to a handful of other researchers. Tex allowed researchers to write their documents in a specified manner that could be emailed and then downloaded and compiled without the need for physical mail. Soon, physicists were emailing and downloading .tex files at great rates hastening the process of research communication. Such a system immediately created a new problem of information overload with researchers 15mb computers filling up quickly with emails (Ginsparg 2011).&nbsp; To address this problem, an automated email server, arXiv, was set up in the early 90's, which would allow researchers to automatically request preprints via email. It would soon become one of the world's first web servers and today serves as one of the most open and efficient forms of research communication in the world. &nbsp;</div><div>Originally launched as an automated email server to help researchers manage a growing influx of papers being shared via email, the&nbsp;arXiv was one of&nbsp; the first US Web servers and has been from the outset&nbsp;an integral tool for physicists to disseminate their research, receiving four hundred submissions within the first six months <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ginsparg_2011,O_Connell_2000}</cite>. The rapid growth of arXiv&nbsp;was facilitated by the creation and emergence of new technologies that made document creation and dissemination extremely easy, including email, the personal computer, a typesetting system known as LaTeX, and the World Wide Web. &nbsp;The adoption and growth of arXiv also benefitted from the community it served, specifically high-energy physics, a discipline known for collaboration and data sharing (CITE NEEDED). While the arXiv initially covered only the fields of physics and astronomy, it soon grew&nbsp; to encompass other fields, such as computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance and today publishes over 10,000 articles each month (See Fig <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{859899}</span>). The arXiv was quick to adopt and implement new technologies, however it has arguably changed very little since it's inception, at least technically. &nbsp;Here we look at the strengths and weaknesses of arXiv in an effort to identify what possible improvements can be made based on new technologies and tools and propose that a modern arXiv might in fact not look at all like the arXiv of today, which is a good thing.</div><div></div>
