<h2 data-label="287186" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multi-format and format-neutral</h2><div>The ArXiv relies heavily on LaTeX. The article you are reading was authored on Authorea by three authors using a combination of LaTeX and Rich Text. LaTeX was just a format used to insert mathematical notation, equations, tables, not to typeset and format the entire manuscript. LaTeX writers are the only scholars who waste precious time typesetting their manuscripts <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{brischoux2009don}</cite>&nbsp;- a practice which is not only time consuming for researchers but also useless, since journals outsource the typesetting procedure before publication (even on already typeset documents). The arXiv of the future separats format neutral and separates format from content.</div>
