<h2 data-label="285318" class="ltx_title_subsection">Web-native and web-first</h2><div>There is growing consensus in scholarly communication circles that academic publishing needs to move "beyond the PDF" (see the manifesto of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.force11.org/" target="_blank">Force 11</a>), and we strongly believe that the paper of the future will be web-native&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Goodman}</cite>. As such, the arXiv of the future will have to enable creation and/or ingestion of papers in HTML format. Moving scholarly papers to HTML is the first step towards paving the way for the scholarly repository of the future.
