<h2 data-label="587335" class="ltx_title_subsection">Built for Open Data and Open Research</h2><div>The repository of the future is more than a collection of PDFs with text and images. The repository of the future is a dataspapers that integrate data, code and all the resources needed to reproduce scientific results. The only way to solve the ongoing reproducibility crisis is by making papers data-driven. The paper you are reading has one figure and we have made the data “behind the figure” available to all readers. If you read the online version of the article (insert link), you will be able to click on the Data flag associated with Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{104668}</span> and visualize, download, and peruse the data that is presented in the chart.&nbsp;<b>The arXiv of the future will host data and code alongside papers</b>.</div>
