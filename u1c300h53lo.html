<h2 data-label="587335" class="ltx_title_subsection">Built for Open Data and Open Research</h2><div>The repository of the future is more than a collection of PDFs with text and images. The repository of the future is a database of papers that integrate data, code and all the resources needed to reproduce scientific results. The only way to solve the ongoing reproducibility crisis is by making papers data-driven. The paper you are reading has one figure and we have made the data “behind the figure” available to all readers. If you read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/173764-the-arxiv-of-the-future-will-not-look-like-the-arxiv" target="_blank">online version of the article</a>, you will be able to click on the Data flag associated with Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{104668}</span> and visualize, download, and peruse the data presented in the chart, as well as the code (in the form of a Jupyter Notebook) which we wrote to .&nbsp;<b>The arXiv of the future will host data and code alongside papers</b>.</div>
