<div>The arXiv, pronounced "archive", is the&nbsp;most popular preprint repository in the world. &nbsp;Started in 1991 by physicist Paul Ginsparg, the arXiv allows researchers to freely share  publication-ready articles prior to formal peer review and publication. Today, the arXiv publishes over 10,000 articles each month from high-energy physics, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, quantitative finance, and others (see Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{104668}</span>). The early success of arXiv stems from the introduction of new technological advances paired to a well-developed culture of collaboration and sharing. Indeed, before the arXiv even existed, physicists were already physically sharing recently finished manuscripts via mail, first, and by email, later. &nbsp;To understand the success of the arXiv it is important to understand the history of the arXiv. Below we highlight a brief history of technology, services, and cultural norms that predate the arXiv and were integral to its early and continued success. &nbsp;</div>
