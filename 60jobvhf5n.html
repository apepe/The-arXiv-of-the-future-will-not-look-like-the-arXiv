<div>TeX, pronounced "tech", was developed by Donald Knuth in the late 70's as a way for researchers to  write and typeset articles programmatically. Soon after the introduction of TeX, Leslie Lamport set a standard&nbsp;for TeX formatting, called LaTeX, which made it very easy for all researchers to professionally typeset their documents on their own. This system&nbsp;made sharing papers easier and cheaper than ever before. Indeed, many, if not most, researchers at the time relied upon secretaries or typists to write their work, which then had to be photocopied in order to be sent via mail to a handful of other researchers. TeX allowed researchers to write their documents in a lightweight format  that could be emailed and then downloaded and compiled without the need for physical mail.</div>
